runrson. xvii

In ihc vills subject to the Halmote Court, the
rents were not fixed and certain during the period

covered by this volume. The ancient (antiquus)¹
rent was frequently increased, and as frequently
abated, from which we may infer at this period it
was in the nature of a rach-rent, and varied with the
capabilities of the land or the circumstances of the
tenant. It varied from cd. to ls. per acre. In this
respect the tenants of the Bishop's manors were on a
more favourable footing, as may be seen in comparing
the rents and services of the hond-tonante, as recorded
in Boldon Bulre and Hatfield's Survey. In both Surveys
they are found the same, though two hundred years
intervened. But with regard to the money payments of
the Prior's tenants, it must be observod that careful con·
sideration appears to have been given to the circum-
stances and condition of the tenants‚ as the instances
are numerous where payment is allowed to bc postponed
or abated. Under Spennymoor (p. 16) we see an
allowancc made to the widow ofa former tenant of half
the yearly rent on account of her age and wealrness of
mind.

Those tenants who were niefs (actiui) of the lord were,
in the language of 'the law-hoohsylebae adscripti, and
could not leave the vill without the lord's licencc. lf
they left the vill they required the lord's licence‚ and a
payment was made, pro albocuriae, ie. for the privilege
of living under another lord (see Shields, p. 185).

Hence we find frequent inquiries in the lord's court,

¹The word uictiquus, however, (Sheles) we find illice Morros ad·
may not necessarily imply tha rent monished to for-sake her old habits
was of long standing. At p. 181 (autiquoamorer).
