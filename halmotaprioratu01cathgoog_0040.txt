to the tenants not to play. In East Memington (p. 175)
we see the constables of the vill charged not to allow

his servants to intermeddle.

Another class of offences of which we find numerous

against the master of Westpittell in Heworth (p. 178) for
hunting with his servants within the lord's warren, and
against William Clericus de Tynemouth in Wallscnd
(p. 155). ln this vill the tenants are forbidden to keep
greyhounds for taking hares (p. 165). Le Hopp at
