but the tenants, whether of the blood of the previous
holder or others, ute invariably admitted for life. Thus,
in Pittington (p. 36) John Punshon is admitted for life
to the tenement of Peter Hudson, as neither his widow ¹
nor any of his blood wished to fine ; in Shields (p. 44) a
tenement is taken at an increased rent fot lise, as none
of the blood of the previous tenant wished to fine ; in
F erry (p. 86), a tenement is taken by Matilda, who
was the wife of John Simon, formerly John Hodds,
which came into the Prior's hands in eonsequenee of his
dying without an heir3 und in Southwiek (p. 122) Elias
Raven is admitted to a moiety of u bondage tenement,
which the widow of the previous tenant held in widow-
right, es none of his blood wished to fine. Of the blood
of the last tenant, the heir would, no doubt, be preferred,
but in Shields (p. 18) we have an instance of a toft being
divided into moieties, and taken by the two sons of the
previous tenant, but being found of tendet yeals, and
unable to dispose of the toft, a guardian is appointed fot
eight years, who is to repajr and sustain the toft at his
own costs, he having the profits. He is also to main<
tuin the infants in fond and clothing, and to lodge them
in the toft. At the end οἱ eight years the two sons are
to have and to hold it peaceably, without hindtsnce of
guardian. It would almost seem that in this
unce the sons were twins, ancl the entry is excep-
al in other respeets, as showing a Larger estate than
21 in the tenent, and that there was a riyht of dis-
λίου. In Aycliffe (p. 34) we find the admittanee of
ther infant son in suecession to his father, and a
rdian assigned to him.
