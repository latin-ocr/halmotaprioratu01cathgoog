The Halmote Oourt appears to have been held three
times in each year, via, in the early spring, summer,
and autumn. In consequence of the legal year oom-
mencing on the 25th March, the first turnus commenced
in the summer, the second in the autumn, and the
third in the spring of the following year, according to
our reclroning. The Court is invariably called the
Court of the Prior, in whom were embodied the rights
and authority of the convent, and their consent or
priwity does not appear to have been required in the
Prior's dealings with the tenants. The ninth statute
given for the regulation of the Dean and Chapter soon
after their foundation seems to recognise the authority
which the Prior had in this matter to aet independently
of the convent: “Licebit tamen Decano, terrarum
visitatori . . . terras, tenemento, prata, pascuas, pis-
carias et decimas locare et dimittere de anuo in annum,
et ad voluntatem domini (ut loquuntur) secundum
consuetudinem maneriorum ecclesiae praedictae, etiarn
non requisito consensu capituli.’'

The Steward Bursar, and Terrar¹ (terrarius) appear
to have had equal authority in holding courts. Some-
times we find the court held before all three, and some-
times before two of these three officials, but always
“with others,'' whose names are not mentioned.
