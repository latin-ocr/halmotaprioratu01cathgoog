when required for repaire, whether in gross or as
“siles'' “firsts,'' “spara'' and “riba'’ is specielly
allowed by the lord or his officers. For deterioration
of land, not manuring, or taking manure out of the
lordship, damages are assessed 3 also for cultivating out
of course, as in Willington (p. 105), where we see a
tenant had taken a crop of oats instead of beans or
peas. Trespasses, as might be expected, on the neigh-
bour's corn, when the open-field system of cultivation
was in use, are frequent. Hirsill, or the obliga-tion of
the tenants to send their cattle, gecse, and pigs from the
vill under proper custody, would obviate to some extent
the want offences ; but we constantly find hot disputes
among the tenants from this cause, which often led
first to hard words and then to blows. Indeed, the
frequent orders upon the tenants not to transgress in
word or deod, or with staves, amows, or knives, and the
numerous fines for drawing knives to striks, and (though
less frequently) striking with hainae, and the volu-
bility of the villans in court, rather suggest some points
of resemblance between the tenants of the Prior and
the peasantry of to=day in our sister isle. Attendance
at the lord's court was strictly enforced, and the fines
sor absence, or being late, are frequent. Contempt of
court was not unknown; thus wc find fines imposed
for refusing to be silent in court, speaking contemptu-
ously of the jury, and imputing to them falsehood.
Brewing of beer appears to have been farmed from
the Prior. It was therefore necessary to give brewers
protection, and accordingly we find it an offense to buy
beer outside the vill and sell it within. ln Shields
