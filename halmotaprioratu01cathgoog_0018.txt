Oourt of the Prior and Convent and commences with
the earliest roll extant, vin„ for the year 1296.

Besides affording much informationasto the conditione
on which thc land was held, and the methods of its culti-
vation, they give us a vivid picture of the rural popula·
tion of the county of Durham during the period covered
by the rolls3 indeed, it is hardly a figure of speech to
say we have in them village life photographed. The
dry record of tenures is peopled by the men and women
who occupied them, whose acquaintance we make in
these records under the various phasee of village life.
We see them in their tofts, surrounded by their crof ,
with their gardens of pot-hcrbs. We sce how they
ordered the affairs of the village when summoned hy
the bailiff cf the vill to consider matters which all'ccted
the common wcal of the community. We hear of their
trespasses and wrong-doings‚ and how they were
remedied or punished; of their strifcs and contentione,
and how they were repressed; of their attempts, not ι
always ineffective, to grasp the principle of co-operation
as shown by their bye-laws; of their relations with the
Prior, who represented the convent and alone stood in

relation of lord. He appears always to have dealt with
his tenants‚ either in person or through his officere, with
much consideration 3 and in the imposition of fines we
find them invariably tempering justice with mercy.
But of their contents, more presently.

The Court Rolls which are printed in the present
volume are preserved in the Treasury of the Dean and

Damam, but now in the oounty of priscd the vills of East and Wcst
