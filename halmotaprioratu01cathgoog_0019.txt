Chapter of Dus-ham, They are written on skins ofpasch-
ment, stitched together in Chaucery fashion into a long
roll twelve inches wide, and of varying length, but gene-
rally about eight feet. The enti-ies ure carried in dorso
as fsr as the necessities of the scribe, whose business it
was to transcribe the proceedings of the Court, required.
The condition of many of the rolls shows they have suffered
from damp, and consequent decay. The handwriting
is clear and legible, except where the skins are worn
by frequent rolling and unrolling, which have neces-
sarily affected that portion of the manuscript carried to
the back of the rolls. The Latinityis faulty, the result
in most enses of carelessness. Many of the errore have
been silently corrected in the text of this volume, to
prevent the inconvenience which would have been
caused by cal-ling more frequent attention to the gram
matieal errore of the scribe ; enough, however, remain
to justify the charge of carelessness. The rolls are not
printed in their entirety, which would have involved
much useless repetition of similar matter. But no
entry has wittingly been left unnoticed which throws
any light on the tenures of the land or the ways and
habits of the people.
