reunion. XV

(p. 10), William Mayc took a toft and land, which Alan,
son of Peter, held, who during his lile wasto have lodg-
ing ‚in the toft, and three roods of land, in each field
one rood. See also Monlrton (p. 9). The widow invari-
ably succeeded in widow-right to the holding of her hus-
band for life. The fine (persumet) on entry appears to
have been certain, and not excessivo, and frequently was
remittcd, in whole or in part. Without the lord’s con-
sent she could not marry again. Under Newton Bewley
(p. 59) a widow, admitted to two messuages and sixty
acres, is prohibited from marrying again under a fine of
four pounds. If she married she remained tenant, and
was responsible for the aecustomed services but she,
with her husband, might surrender hcr tenement, Thus
under Ayoliffe (p. 23) we see John Fermour admitted to '
a cottage which Emma, the wife of Gilbert Randolf, held,
and which they (Gilbert and Emma) then surrendered ;
and again, under East Rainton (p. 21), we find John
Freman admitted to his mother’s holding, which she and
Robert Thompson, who had married her, surrendered in
court to his use. After thc widow's death perhaps
family considerations rather than custom regulated the
right to admittance. Under Billingham (p. 104) we
. find the husband admitted to the holding of his late¹
' wife ; but under Fulwell theson takes the holding of
his mother, and her husband undertakes to repair a
grange with a pair of “siles '' and two “gavil forcs'' to
the contentment of the son. If the widow did not wish
to hold her husband's tenement, his heir, or, in default,
any of his blood, had the option of succeeding, and fail—
lssg these, the lord would admit any one willing to fine ;
