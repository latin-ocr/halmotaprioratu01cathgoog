¹ The grammar, or want of grammar, in the Survey, is sc peculier, that,
in deference to ite writer, many contrectcd words have been left eo, ee their
extcnnion in the usual way might not heve met with his approvel. The
words have not been exiendcd where there was lhe slightesc doubt 'ee
to whether singular or plural was meant.
For convenience, especially of comparieon with the Burecr’· Rentel of
1539, the Romen numerale in eume heve been supplied by Arabio figures.
