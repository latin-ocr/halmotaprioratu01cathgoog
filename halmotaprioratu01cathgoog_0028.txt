One condition 'under which all the lord's tenants held
was that none could let or exchange their holdings, in
whole or in part, without the lord's licence. If this were
done without authority, the holding was seized into the
lord's hands, and the tenant would only be readmitted
on payment of afurther fine. ln Wolveston (p. 68),
William Sergaunt we find so readmitted to a messuage
and fifteen acres, but the fine is allowed him, and he
has leave to let three acres in each field, one acre for
the term of his life. The liubility to maintain and
leave in sufficient repair the buildings on their holdings
was strictly enjoined and enforoed, though the lord
generally found timber for the purpose. If the tenant
left house, grange, or other building out of repair, the
damages were assessed by the jury, and the goods of
the defaulting tenant arrested for making the necessary
reparation 3 'for a proceeding of this nature see under
Dalion (p. 129).

lf there was a difficulty in finding a tenant, the
uacant holding would be assigned to those who were
of sufficient means to cultivate it ; thus we see in
Pittington (p. 33) amessuage with twenty-eight aeres,
assigned to two tenants, who are found hythe jury
able (potentes) to hold it, and in Billingham (p. 45),
where the lands held by former tenants are assigned to
all the husbandmen of the vill to answer for the rent;
also in Oowpen, where three acres, long lying waste, are
gasigned to all the tenants of the vill, until some tenant

should corne who should be willing to take them.
The demesne lands of the vill or lordship were
demised at the lord's court, and the tenants admitted,
